# PDF-document-question-answering-LLM-System
This project is a Streamlit app  using LangChain and OpenAI. Users enter queries to get answers from pdf's that are uploaded. It loads documents, splits them, generates embeddings, and indexes them with Pinecone. The app then performs similarity searches and provides answers using a QA chain and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.
